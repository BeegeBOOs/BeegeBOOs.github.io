          <h1>What is an Autonomous Car?</h1>
          <p>An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement.
            A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger
            required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and
            do everything that an experienced human driver does.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid_add_text">
          <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from
            Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous). These levels have been adopted by the U.S. Department
            of Transportation. </p>

          <h1>Lidar and Radar</h1>
          <p>Lidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If
            multiple
            autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if
            multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of
            autonomous cars?

          <p>Level 0 (No Driving Automation)
            Most vehicles on the road today are Level 0: manually controlled. The human provides the "dynamic driving
            task" although there may be systems in place to help the driver. An example would be the emergency braking
            system―since it technically doesn’t "drive" the vehicle, it does not qualify as automation.

          <h1>Weather Conditions</h1>
          <p>What happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there’s a layer of snow on the road,
            lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured
            by water, oil, ice, or debris?

          <p>Level 1 (Driver Assistance)
            This is the lowest level of automation. The vehicle features a single automated system for driver
            assistance, such as steering or accelerating (cruise control). Adaptive cruise control, where the vehicle
            can be kept at a safe distance behind the next car, qualifies as Level 1 because the human driver monitors
            the other aspects of driving such as steering and braking.

          <p>Level 2 (Partial Driving Automation)
            This means advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS. The vehicle can control both steering and
            accelerating/decelerating. Here the automation falls short of self-driving because a human sits in the
            driver’s seat and can take control of the car at any time. Tesla Autopilot and Cadillac (General Motors)
            Super Cruise systems both qualify as Level 2.

          <h1>State vs. Federal Regulation</h1>
          <p>The regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates
            for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the
            rise of “zombie cars” driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that
            all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going
            to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?

          <p>Level 3 (Conditional Driving Automation)
            The jump from Level 2 to Level 3 is substantial from a technological perspective, but subtle if not
            negligible from a human perspective.

            Level 3 vehicles have “environmental detection” capabilities and can make informed decisions for themselves,
            such as accelerating past a slow-moving vehicle. But―they still require human override. The driver must
            remain alert and ready to take control if the system is unable to execute the task.

          <h1>Accident Liability</h1>
          <p>Who is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest
            blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a
            human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.

          <p>Level 4 (High Driving Automation)
            The key difference between Level 3 and Level 4 automation is that Level 4 vehicles can intervene if things
            go wrong or there is a system failure. In this sense, these cars do not require human interaction in most
            circumstances. However, a human still has the option to manually override.

            Level 4 vehicles can operate in self-driving mode. But until legislation and infrastructure evolves, they
            can only do so within a limited area (usually an urban environment where top speeds reach an average of
            30mph). This is known as geofencing. As such, most Level 4 vehicles in existence are geared toward
            ridesharing.

            reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers—to make split-second judgment calls and
            predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same

            Level 5 vehicles do not require human attention―the “dynamic driving task” is eliminated. Level 5 cars won’t
            even have steering wheels or acceleration/braking pedals. They will be free from geofencing, able to go
            anywhere and do anything that an experienced human driver can do. Fully autonomous cars are undergoing
            testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public.
